title: Jewish Activism Summer School (JASS)
description: "JASS’ mission is to empower civil engagement by offering programs,
  informed by Jewish values, that educate, train and challenge, in our shared
  fight for democracy, human rights and a healthy and sustainable world. JASS is
  unique in offering Jews and non-Jews alike a serious and practical education
  in Jewish traditional approaches to Tikkun Olam (repairing the world),
  historical examples of Jewish activism, and an interdisciplinary cluster of
  skills and methods applicable to any issue area. Meant to delve into the
  Jewish experience and fountains of wisdom, JASS invites non Jewish
  participants to take part in the program. We believe in the constructive power
  of dialogue and mutual understanding, and welcome allies of different views
  and experiences with open arms. "
